A higher value means more diverse and unpredictable tag usage.</li>\n","            <li><b>POS Transition Probabilities (Advanced):</b> Analyze the probability of moving from one tag to another (e.g., what's the probability that a Noun is followed by a Verb?). We can use the entropy of this transition matrix as a feature.</li>\n","        </ul>\n","    </li>\n","    <li>\n","        <b>Analysis & Integration:</b> We will then group the data by label (AI vs. Human) and compare the means and distributions of these new syntactic features.
